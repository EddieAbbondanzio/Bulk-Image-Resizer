Imagizer
=====

Command line script for re-sizing images. Allows for two different
sizes based on if the image is detected to be in landscape, or portrait
mode.

How to use
-----

Open up the project in Visual Studio or if you just want to run the .exe
it can be found in Imagizer/Imagizer/bin/Release.

You will then be prompted for the folder containing the images, if
the original files should be saved, and what dimensions you'd like.
Be careful about not saving originals, especially if your not sure
about how the output will look.
